SECURITY POLICY
Copyright (c) 2025 宋子桓（Song Zihuan）

We take the security of this project seriously. If you believe you have found a 
security vulnerability, please report it to us responsibly.

---

1. Reporting a Vulnerability
----------------------------
Please do NOT open a public issue or pull request.

Instead, send an email to:
  security@song-zh.com

Please include:
  - A clear description of the issue
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Impact assessment (if known)
  - Suggested fix (optional but appreciated)

---

2. Disclosure Policy
--------------------
We follow a 90-day coordinated disclosure timeline:
  - Day 0: Report received and acknowledged
  - Day 1–30: Fix developed and tested
  - Day 31–60: Patch prepared for release (including downstream coordination)
  - Day 61–90: Public disclosure and CVE assignment (if applicable)

If the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild, we may shorten this window.

We will credit all reporters in the release notes (unless you request anonymity).

---

3. Supported Versions
---------------------
Only the latest minor version of each major release line receives security updates.

Unsupported versions will not receive patches. Please upgrade to a supported version.

---

4. Security Headers & Best Practices
------------------------------------
This project does not enforce runtime security policies (e.g., CSP, HSTS) — 
those are the responsibility of the deployment environment.

Developers are encouraged to:
  - Keep dependencies updated (use `dependabot` or similar)
  - Scan for vulnerabilities with tools like `trivy`, `snyk`, or `osv-scanner`
  - Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines when integrating this software

---

5. Legal Notice
---------------
Reporting a vulnerability does not grant you permission to:
  - Publicly disclose before coordination
  - Exploit the vulnerability beyond proof-of-concept (no data exfiltration, DoS, etc.)
  - Demand compensation (we are an open source project)

Misuse of reported vulnerabilities may violate the LEGAL terms and applicable laws.

See: LEGAL for lawful use and liability disclaimer.

Thank you for helping make this project more secure.
