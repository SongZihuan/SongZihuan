LEGAL NOTICE AND COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
Copyright (c) 2025 宋子桓（Song Zihuan）

1. Lawful Use Only
------------------
This software is provided for lawful use only.
You are strictly prohibited from using this software — or any derivative work — to:
- Violate any applicable local, national, or international laws or regulations;
- Engage in fraud, cybercrime, unauthorized access, data theft, or harassment;
- Bypass security measures, disrupt services, or harm infrastructure;
- Infringe on intellectual property, privacy, or human rights.

2. No Warranty & Limitation of Liability
----------------------------------------
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES,
OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM MISUSE, ILLEGAL USE, OR UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATION.

3. User Responsibility
----------------------
You acknowledge that:
- You are solely responsible for ensuring your use complies with all applicable laws.
- You will not hold the project maintainers, contributors, or hosting platforms liable
  for consequences arising from your use — legal or otherwise.

4. Reporting Abuse
------------------
If you become aware of malicious or illegal use of this software, please report it to:
  Email: work@song-zh.com
  Security Policy: See SECURITY.txt or project documentation.

5. Governing Law (Default)
--------------------------
Unless otherwise explicitly stated in a separate contributor agreement, project policy,
or official documentation, the default governing law for interpreting this notice
shall be the laws of the jurisdiction where the initial commit of this software project
was made.

This default is intended to reflect the "most significant relationship" or "closest connection"
principle recognized in private international law — which seeks to apply the law of the place
with the strongest factual and legal connection to the matter at hand.

This designation:
   • Does NOT impose mandatory jurisdiction or venue on users or contributors;
   • Does NOT require disputes to be litigated in any specific court;
   • Is solely for the purpose of providing a predictable, objective baseline for
     interpreting the terms of this notice in the absence of other agreements.

Users and contributors remain free to negotiate alternative governing law in writing
(e.g., via a Contributor License Agreement).
